# Topic: Setting up a Linux computer for everyday use.

###  Install Ubuntu 20.04
#### Want to know how to install and set up a computer to run Ubuntu Version 20.04? With Linux you will experience true freedom. But before you get a glimpse of that freedom you will need to meet some requirements. 

#### Requirements: 
1.	4GB RAM - At least 4GB otherwise you will suffer.
2.	Dual Core Processor (2 GHZ) 
3.	40GB free disk space (Minimum disk space 25GB) 
4.	Reliable internet Connection - To download the program/iso
5.	Installation media (ISO) [Operating system image]  https://ubuntu.com/download/desktophttps://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
6.	Download Virtual Box - Pick the package according to your platform wether is Mac OS, Linux or a Windows host. -  h![Follow this](finalimgs/tools.PNG)

#### Name your machine and select the Linux (Ubuntu) version 64 Bits

#### Set the ram for whatever amount higher than 4GB but make sure your machine has a good amount of ram for virtualization and cpu cores for processes/applications running the in the background.

<br>


#### Create a virtual hard disk since there is no virtual hard disk available

<br>![Follow this](finalimgs/tools.PNG)


#### Select VirtualBox Disk Image
![Follow this](finalimgs/V4.PNG)
<br>

#### Select Dynamically allocated for better storage rendering in your local storage. 
![Follow this](finalimgs/V5.PNG)
<br>

#### Set the storage amount to your liking. In this tutorial the amount is 40GB
![Follow this](finalimgs/V6.PNG)
<br>

#### Once finished, head over to the settings tab and make the shared clipboard/Drag'n'Drop feature Bidirectional. This will open the door for sharing files between the main operating system and the one running in the virtual machine. Great tool for multitasking!

<br>

![Follow this](finalimgs/V8.PNG)
#### For great video response time max out the video memory to 128MB. Also this is the opportunity to select the monitor count if you wish to virtualize the machine in dual monitors or up to 8. I have the option for 2 monitors but I will leave it at 1.
<br>

#### Uncheck the floppy disk and bring the optical and hard drisk up in the list using the up arrow icon right next to the boot order window. 
<br>

![Follow this](finalimgs/V10.PNG)
#### Select the amount of cores you wish your machine to run with. For dual core cpu I recommend using 1 and the other 1 core will be runned in the background for main system purposes. In my case I will use 4 out of 8. The more cores the better performance.

#### At this point you will select the iso you downloaded from the original source.

### How to Update Ubuntu and best practices?
Since ubuntu 14.04 we have a new command called "apt". The following command will list out all the packages that you can update, what their current versions are, and what the new version is at the time your machine performed the search. 

'sudo apt list --upgradable'

You are then asked in the CLI wether or not you will like to install the updates. To approve type Y otherwise press N and press Enter key after inserting the choice desired.
