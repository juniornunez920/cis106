Questions to answer
## Which project will you be completing?

* For the purpose of the final project I will be building a file server. They are 3 options of which I still need to decide between SAMBA, NFS and Openmediavault. The decision will be made within a week of start.
  
### Why have you chosen this project?

* I have always to create my own file server and with a raspberry pi it will be more fun even.

### What are the possible problems, roadblocks, or difficulties you anticipate during the process of completing the project?

* Limitations might be lack of compability between files or lack of storage. But down the road those issues will be fixed. Risk management is one of the skills I will seek to run in order to prevent catastrophes.


### How are you planning to overcome these difficulties?

* Creating a plan to overcome these difficulties in the best way possible would be with creating a weekly plan. Passive progress is better than rushing it all at once. 


### How do you think completing this project will help you in your career?
 *  My Major is IT with the Network Administration Option. In the future I will be dealing ith servers and storages, and this might be the guide to a small peek of what is to come for me later on.
